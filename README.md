- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel. I use @DanielsSim for a storage place for simulation code and late-night thoughts that I just have to get out of my code.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in multibody dynamics, statistics, philosophy of science and more. 
- ðŸ“« I have a blog at http://hmbd.wordpress.com but I'm slowly shifting content to https://danielssim.github.com/site
